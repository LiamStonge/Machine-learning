# Machine-learning-basics
A few machine learning models. I created 3 machine learning (Supervised learning) models. All were written in python, there is the Artificial neural network, the recurrent neural network, and the convolutional neural network. I made these out of curiosity in the field of machine learning, I wished to better understand how these programs work.

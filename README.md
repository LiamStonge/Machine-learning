# Machine-learning-basics
A few machine learning models. I created 3 machine learning (Supervised learning) models. All were written in python using powerful libraries such as keras, theano, tensorflow, and pytorch(better to use on linux or virtual machine). There is the Artificial neural network, the recurrent neural network, and the convolutional neural network. I'm a student at Concordia university in computer science. These programs were made on my own time outside of school out of interest in the field of machine learning.

# Machine-learning-basics
A few machine learning models. I created 4 machine learning models, 3 Supervised learning models and 1 unsupervised learning model. 
- Artificial neural network
- Recurrent neural network
- Convolutional neural network
- The unsupervised learning model is the Boltzmann machine.  

These programs were made on my own time outside of school out of interest in the field of machine learning.

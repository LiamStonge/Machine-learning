# Machine-learning-basics
A few machine learning models.. I created 4 machine learning models, 3 Supervised learning models and 1 unsupervised learning model. The first one I created is the Artificial neural network, the second is the recurrent neural network, the third is the convolutional neural network and the unsupervised learning model is the Boltzmann machine. These programs were made on my own time outside of school out of interest in the field of machine learning.

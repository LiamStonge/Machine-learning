# Recurrent-neural-network
My first Recurrent neural network, able to predict the next days opening **stock price of any company**. 


#### Brief description of Program: 
You enter the symbol for the companies stock, the program then takes out data from yahoo finances (you can specifie a start date and end date for the data). 
The program converts that data into a readable format for my Recurrent neural network. 
After this the RNN trains with the given data set. The Network can now predict the next days stock price, a graph showing a test visualizing both actual price and predicted prices. This is used more to show a trend then knowing what the actual price will be. 

This project is still ongoing and the code is not final.

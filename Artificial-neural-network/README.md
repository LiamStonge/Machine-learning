## Artificial Neural Network
This is my first neural network. To test this network I used a superficial dataset of bank accounts (this is based on a course given 
online). The network takes in the data of the account and checks if an account has been closed, creating correlation between data to discover why it has been closed. Once the AI has been trained with sufficient data it can predict whether an account will be closed or not.
